The main bottleneck is the synchronous, chunk-based transfer protocol where each 256-byte chunk requires a complete request-response cycle, causing the number of operations (and thus time) to scale linearly with file size. The small chunk size combined with sequential processing means large files require thousands of round trips, with each incurring network and processing overhead.

Correlation Coefficient (r): 0.9995 RÂ² Value: 0.9990
This indicates an extremely strong linear correlation between file size and transfer time.
